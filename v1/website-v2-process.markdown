## Process

This is the main website for BrickMMO. This first version was constructed using React and MUI but was never completed or deployed. The second version is in progress and currenlty deployed. 

---

### Already Completed

The About Website website already has the About Site Template applied and the Version One documents exist. 

*** 

### Steps

1. Version Two

    Create a `v2.markdown` page. Use the `v1.markdown` as a starting point.

    Remove any links to documents. Update the related links to include [website-v2](https://github.com/BrickMMO/website-v2). Change the image to the same image as the `index.markdown` file. 

    Add this description:

    > The second version is in progress and currenlty deployed.
   
    Fix the `Back to About` link at the bottom of the `v2.markdown` page.

    Add `Adam Thomas` as the a contributor. You can get content from the [about-flow](https://brickmmo.github.io/flow-about/v1) website.
