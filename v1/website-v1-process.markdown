## Process

This is the main website for BrickMMO. This first version was constructed using React and MUI but was never completed or deployed. The second version is in progress and currenlty deployed. 

---

### Already Completed

The About Website website already has the About Site Template applied and the Version One documents exist. 

*** 

### Steps

1. The About Website home page does not have the correct information on it. Update the description. Update the image to be a screenshot of the [current website](https://brickmmo.com/). 

    Replace the sample link with a link to the [BrickMMO website](https://brickmmo.com/).

2. Version One

    Update the `v1.markdown` page. Remove any links to documents and the image. Update the related links to include [website-v1](https://github.com/BrickMMO/website-v1).

    Add this description:

    > This is the main website for BrickMMO. This first version was constructed using React and MUI but was never completed or deployed. 
   
    Fix the `Back to About` link at the bottom of the `v1.markdown` page.

    Add `Adam Thomas` as the only contributor. You can get content from the [about-flow](https://brickmmo.github.io/flow-about/v1) website.
   
[&#10132; Back to V2](/radio-about/v2)
