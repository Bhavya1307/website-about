## Process

This is the main website for BrickMMO. This first version was constructed using React and MUI but was never completed or deployed. The second version is in progress and currenlty deployed. 

---

### Already Completed

The About Website website already has the About Site Template applied and the Version One documents exist. 

*** 

### Steps

1. **Home Page**

    Add a verion link on the home page using `Version 2 - MUI/React Template` to `/v2`.

2. **Version Two**

    Create a `v2.markdown` page. Use the `v1.markdown` as a starting point.

    Add a link in the `Related Links` section to [website-v2](https://github.com/BrickMMO/website-v2). Uee the text `Version 1 GitHub Repo`.
  
3. **Image**

    Change the image to the same image as the `index.markdown` file added in the previous process requirements.  

4. **V1 Page Content**

    Add this description:

    > The second version of the official BrickMMO Website is in progress and currenlty deployed. This verion uses [Webbee MUI Template\(https://mui.com/store/items/webbee-landing-page/). 
   
    Add a link to this process document and the `website-v2-process-content.markdown` process document. See the [v1](https://brickmmo.github.io/stop-start-about/v1) page in the [stop-start-about](https://github.com/BrickMMO/stop-start-about) repo as an example. 

    Fix the `Back to About` link at the bottom of the `v2.markdown` page.

5. **Contributors

    Add `Adam Thomas` as the a contributor. You can get content from the [about-flow](https://brickmmo.github.io/flow-about/v1) website. 

    Also get a list of other students to add from your instructor in class.
